# Click_through_rate_vs_conversion_classification
A **click-through** identifies if people have clicked your ad to visit a website or landing page. A **Conversion** displays the scale of people (zero, low or high) completed an action out of the total number of visitors. <br />
A **unique classification approach** was established to solve the problem statement. First, converted the object and string features into meaningful values, handled the missing values  and carried out feature visualization. Feature addition was performed using **k-means clustering method** to add functionalities. The problem statement was divided into 2 parts by prepraing a model that identifies if click will happen and then from another model we to predicted if conversion will happen or not from those clicks using the basic **logistic regression model**.
